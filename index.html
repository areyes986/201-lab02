        <h2>Allyson Reyes</h2>
        <p> I was raised in a small town on the island of Oahu and had recently moved to Seattle last year in search of
            better career opportunites.
            At first, I wanted to work on mental health and went to the University of Hawaii at Manoa for psychology.
            After school it was tough to find a job so I had applied to work in a dental office because the job was
            available at the time.
            I really do like the dental field and wanted to pursue that further and possibly go into hygiene.
            However, the dental industry in Hawaii is saturated and there are no hygiene schools. Which is why I had
            moved
            to Seattle.
            I am working at a dental office right now and unfortunately, all hygienists I have met had swayed me away
            from
            being one!
            It is very hard on your body and there is no room for career advancement! Unless you wanted to become a
            dentist
            of course.
            I let my boss know about my interest and concern about going into this field and she said that coding is
            something that I should look into.
            I took it with a grain of salt at first however but with research on how limited this field is I began to
            think
            of coding more often.
            My goal would be able to just live a comfortable life and being able to provide for myself by myself. I
            think
            coding will be able to help me to that.
            Now I am here learning how to coding hoping to provide for my puppy, Mochi. </p>
